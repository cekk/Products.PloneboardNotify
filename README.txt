Tested on
---------

* Plone 3.3 (Ploneboard 2.1)

Plone 2.5 no more?
------------------

Maybe that also this release works on Plone 2.5, but I'm not testing on it anymore. If you need it,
please use an older version like `PloneboardNotify 0.3`__

Thanks to

TODO
----

* Current version support global configuration and forum specific ones; the long-term
  plan wanna reach also forum area configurations.
* Also manipulate the FROM part of the mail, configurable globally, for single forum, etc.
* Forum outside the Forum Area are not supported by the configuration UI.
* A complete, clean uninstall procedure that remove all unwanted stuff.
